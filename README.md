# NewsNest
NewsNest is a web app I developed as a personal project. On NewsNest website you just have to provide your email once and you will receive top headlines of each day along with their source directly in your email inbox at 6 in the morning daily. I used Flask framework for developing the application. MySQL is used for database. For the news source I used the News API provided by Google. Python version- 3.8.2 API- News API by google (https://newsapi.org/) Database- MySQL I used smtplib for sending emails apscheduler for automating the emails in background while main flask app is running.
